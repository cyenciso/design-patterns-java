# design-patterns-java

This repository is for learning and understanding popular software development design patterns. A design pattern is a solution to a common software design problem. Currently I am using the book *Head First Design Patterns*, written by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson with Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates.

## OOP Principles to Keep in Mind
* encapsulate what changes
* favor composition of inheritance
* program to interfaces, not implementations

## Pattern Links
