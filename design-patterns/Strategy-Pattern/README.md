# Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. -- Head First Design Patterns, page 24.

## My Take-Away
Takes the implementation out of an inheritance chain. An interface represents a behavior/some functionality and concrete classes are created for the sole purpose of providing those implementations. These classes can be used rather than locking the behavior/functionality into an inheritance chain.
