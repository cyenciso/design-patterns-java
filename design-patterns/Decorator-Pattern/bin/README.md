# Decorator Pattern
Allows you to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. -- Head First Design Patterns, page 91.

## My Take-Away
The decorator pattern allows you to create wrappers for objects of the same type. The wrappers can add functionality to the wrapped object, essentially adding functionality at runtime rather than through inheritance, which is less flexible.
